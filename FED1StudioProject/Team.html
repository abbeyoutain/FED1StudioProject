                            At twenty-one, Emma Woodhouse is the youngest president the academy has had. Handsome and clever with a happy disposition, Emma has very little to distress or vex her, but much still does. Emma lives with her father in their home Hartfield in the English countryside near the village of Highbury. In her free time, she practices playing the role of matchmaker amongst her friends and acquaintances, much to their chagrin.
